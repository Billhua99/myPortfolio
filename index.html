        <h2>About Me:</h2>
        <p>I am an aspiring web developer, who wants to make decent money. I see growth in tech and would like to be part of that movement. I have postponed continuing my education in college, but eventually will complete my degree. I have always liked looking at how code is displayed and the money behind it. My determination is my only obstacle that is in my way, but if I can overcome it, I have no worry to succeed.</p>
